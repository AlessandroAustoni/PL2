# PL2 (by AlessandroAustoni)
This repo is created to perform change detection by C2VA given two satellite images of the same area from two different time instants. A first step of coregistration is needed for a more accurate alignment of the two acquisitions and, thus, less errors in the change detection step. Indeed, the repository is composed of two main scripts: “Coregistration.ipynb” and “CD.ipynb”.
For a correct functioning of the code, please make sure to create a folder called “DATABASE” outside the main folder. Make sure to have stored also the Gefolki repository that you can download [here](https://github.com/aplyer/gefolki "Gefolki's github repo"), located to the same path of the “DATABASE” folder.
The Gefolki package is necessary to run the coregistration script.
The database folder is used to store the raw satellite acquisitions that are used in the analysis (and will be lately accessed in the script through the database path). The coregistration script will also automatically generate some intermediate outputs during coregistration (in "DATABASE" folder) that will be lately used in the Change Detection script.

For deeper insights on the work, please have a look to the following [documentation](https://github.com/AlessandroAustoni/EO/blob/main/A%20COMPARISON%20BETWEEN%20MULTI-SPECTRAL%20AND%20HYPERSPECTRAL%20FOR%20WATER%20AND%20AGRICULTURAL%20FIELDS%20CHANGE%20DETECTION%20USING%20C2VA.pdf "Alessandro Austoni A COMPARISON BETWEEN MULTI-SPECTRAL AND HYPERSPECTRAL FOR WATER AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS CHANGE DETECTION USING C2VA")
